termstat

This program was forked from my dwm status bar. It contains the same syntax
and function created by myself, but all X11 support was dropped so almost 
nothing remains from the original code of dwmstatus.

Monitors:
	- Temperature (temp_zone0)
	- Network Interfaces' IP address
	- Battery real status (BAT0)
	- CPU usage
	- Date and time, local time
